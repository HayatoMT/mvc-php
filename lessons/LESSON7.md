Lesson 7
========

To finish I just changed the folders structure a little bit to show that we only need to make our `index.php` and `.htacces` files public. All the real code can be safe in a folder that can't be acessed directly.

Well, that's it, folks. :)
I hope to have helped you learn a little bit with this humble "course".
Feedback is welcome.
