Lesson 3
========

In this lesson we introduce the Controllers, our C from MVC.
Technically this makes us create some sort of view, because we removed almost all the PHP code from the files with HTML, but not good enough yet.
The Controllers are responsible for dealing with the user interactions and giving the right response for these actions.
As we are in a web environment here, this means dealing with the diferent request data sent by the user and choosing which model and view are the right ones to use on that.
For now we are not using it to choose the view yet. But we will get there soon.
Note how as soon as we moved the code to the controllers we were again able to remove duplicate code in a nice way.
