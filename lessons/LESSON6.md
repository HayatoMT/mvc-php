Lesson 6
========

In this lesson we add a complementary component to the MVC patter to our application.
This component is the __Router__. The router is the component responsible for mapping an url to a determined controller.
With the router we gain more flexibility to use the urls the way we want.
Our Router is very simple and just gives us the ability to configure the routes in a simple php array.
Normally routers are able to do much more, like mapping pattern based urls, making reverse routes to create links for the application, etc.
We will keep it simple for our example. I am adding it more because almost all the MVC frameworks for PHP have some sort of Router.
