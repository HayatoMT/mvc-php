Lesson 2
========

In this lesson we introduce our Models. Our first letter from MVC.
The models are simply classes responsible for holding our application logic and/or business rules.
With this change we get more organization, more reusability and some ease of maintenance.
Because now, if we need to change our phrases or how they are choosen we just need to go directly to the respective model class instead of having to find the code in the middle of the html code.
By using this we also begin to transform our code in Object Oriented code. This gives us the ability to reuse code through inheritance and all the other benefits of Object Orientation.
