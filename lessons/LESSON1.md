Lesson 1
========

In this lesson we just make a simple web site using normal PHP code.
I tried to put a little bit of everything here while keeping it simple.
We have two categories of phrases for the user to choose.
Upon choosing a category he will receive a random phrase from that category.
Each phrase has a number and can be acessed directly by filling a simples form with the phrase number.
So we simply create 3 php files with html + php code in it and problem solved.
While it solved the problem, please pay attention to the code being repeated. And just think about what would happen if the site started to grow.
As all the code is mixed with the php. Soon we would start to have a lot of lines on that files and changing things would be hard for both the designers and developers.
